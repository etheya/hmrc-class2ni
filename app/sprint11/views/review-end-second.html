                                A ‘contribution week’ is defined as a period of seven days beginning with midnight between Saturday and Sunday. The first day of the contribution week is Sunday and Saturday is the last. The first week of the contribution year starts on the first Sunday after 5 April.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                So, for example, the first contribution week of the 2014 to 2015 contribution year starts on Sunday 6 April 2014 and ends on Saturday 11 April 2015. Some contribution years will include 53 contribution weeks.
